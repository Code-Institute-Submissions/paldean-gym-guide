I used fontjoy to choose a pairing of fonts and google fonts for the import link. The fonts chosen are arima madurai for the body and fanwood text for the headings. I used sans- serif as the backup text font for accessibiliy.
####Imagery
All images included in the website have been taken by the author from the Pokemon Violet game. The hero image chosen is that of a landscape in the game a player meets early on, with the university in the center of the image and the lush greens and browns of the beautiful nature of Paldea at the forefront. I chose this imahge as the hero image as I believe it is a very aesthetically pleasing for the user.

##Features to implement in future
Pokemon Scarley and Violet are very expansive open world game and the possibilites are endless with the routes to take and the areas to explore. I have chosen to focus on one of the possible routes a player can take and there are many more other challenges in store throughout the world of Paldea. In future I would like to include a page with information on battlng the five titans and the five team star leaders. I would like to include a section on the new pokemon that have been introduced in generation 9 with users voting for their new favourite pokemon and to implement a quiz for users to particpate in with questions regarding the games and the new generation pokemon.
