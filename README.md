### Design

#### Color Scheme

![Chosen palette](assets/images/palette%20paldea.png)

The main colors used are Russian Green, Shiny Shamrock, Eggshell and Deep Taupe. The color scheme was chosen by uploading the hero image to the [coolors](https://coolors.co) website and choosing a selection of the colors identified in the image.

#### Typography

I used [Fontjoy](https://fontjoy.com) to choose a pairing of fonts and [Googlefonts](https://googlefonts.com) for the import link. The fonts chosen are Arima Madurai for the body and Fanwood Text for the headings. I used sans-serif as the backup text font for accessibility.

#### Imagery

All images included in the website have been taken by the author from the Nintendo Switch Pokémon Violet and Scarlet games. The hero image chosen is that of a landscape in the game the player encounters early on with the Academy in the center of the image and the lush greens and browns of the beautiful nature of Paldea at the forefront. I chose this image as the hero image as I believe it is a very aesthetically pleasing for the user and evokes a positive emotive response from the user.

## Future Features

Pokémon Violet and Pokémon Scarlet are very expansive open world games with endless possibilities on the route to take and the areas to explore.

- I would like to include a section on the new Pokémon that have been introduced in generation 9 with users having the facility to vote for their new favourite Pokémon.
- To implement a quiz for users to particpate in with questions regarding the games and the new generation Pokémon.

### Testing User Stories
#### First time users
1. The users found the content easy to read and understand and recommended the site is kept simple and not overloaded with too much detail.
2. The users confirmed the weaknesses listed were accurate for the Pokémon universe and confirmed the site was from a credible source.
3. Users found the site easy to navigate and all links, both internal and external, worked.

### Testing on Browers and Devices

#### Browser Testing
The website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge.

- The layout and positioning on all three applications appear consistent.
- The internal and external links all work. The external links open in a new tab.
- The form on the contact us page accepts input and will not allow the user to submit unless a name and email are given and the email requires the @.
- The website is responsive on all applications.
- The linked youtube video plays in all applications.

#### Device Testing
The website was tested on a variety of devices including desktop, HP laptops, Samsung Galaxy and iPhone 13 devices.
Family members were asked to check the website on their devices and highlight any issues with overlap, images loading or links.

#### Lighthouse Testing
I carried out a lighthouse report using the Google Chrome Lighthouse function for desktop and mobile. The results returned are very positive for accessibility, best practices, search engine optimisation and excellent performance on desktop view and very good on mobile.

### Bugs

#### Unfixed bugs

- When testing on the html validator for the gallery.html file an error returned recommending to use h2-h6 elements inside the section or to use a div element.
- I wrapped the image elements in a div container inside the section element however the error message still appears.
![error message gallery](assets/images/html-checker-gallery-unfixed.PNG)

#### Solved bugs
- When testing the deployed website for responsivity, on larger desktop screen sizes, the hero image cover text was appearing very far right of the image. Fixed this position issue for desktop screens with media queries targetting screens larger than 1300px and 1400px.

![Am I responsive](assets/images/am-i-responsive-first-run.PNG)

- After the first deployment of the site the following actions needed to be taken:
1. The bulbapedia link was listed as .com, its the .net site that required linking to, which has been fixed on all four pages.
2. There was a large vertical gap on the contact us page between the navigation bar and the contact section, this was fixed by removing the height property given.
3. Family members tested the site on a variety of android and iphone devices, there was more overlap on the iPhone13 model on the home page screen than the Samsung devices so I included additional media queries to target smaller screen sizes to account for this. 

## Deployment

Github was used to deploy the site.
### Instructions
1. Login to github.com
2. Click the project title under the list of repositories.
3. Click on the settings option.
4. Click on pages on the left hand side under the code and automation heading.
5. Under the heading of build and deployment click the branch drop down menu and select main and click save.
