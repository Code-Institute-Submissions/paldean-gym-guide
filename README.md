### Design

#### Color Scheme

![Chosen palette](assets/images/palette%20paldea.png)

The main colors chosen are Tuscany, Russian Green and Deep Taupe.

#### Typography

I used fontjoy.com to choose a pairing of fonts and googlefonts for the import link. The fonts chosen are Arima Madurai for the body and Fanwood Text for the headings. I used sans- serif as the backup text font for accessibiliy.

#### Imagery

All images included in the website have been taken by the author from the Nintendo Switch Pokémon Violet game. The hero image chosen is that of a landscape in the game a player encounters early on with the university in the center of the image and the lush greens and browns of the beautiful nature of Paldea at the forefront. I chose this image as the hero image as I believe it is a very aesthetically pleasing for the user and evokes a positive emotive response from the user.
